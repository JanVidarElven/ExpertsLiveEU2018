## Contents

The PowerShell examples in this folder consists of:

* graphSimplePowerShell.ps1. If you have an AccessToken (for example aquired with TokenPlease() as demonstrated in the 101 session), you can easily start explore Microsoft Graph.
* graphPowerShell.ps1. This script utilizes the libraries included in the AzureAD/AzureADPreview PowerShell modules for ADAL authentication and getting Access Token. You can either specify your own App Id/Client Id or use one of the well known client id's for Intune PowerShell or Azure PowerShell.
* graphAppRegistration.ps1. This script helps you create an Azure AD App Registration for using Microsoft Graph.
